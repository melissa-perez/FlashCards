## Lab 2

### App Description
FlashCards v2 has less limited functionality. The app can now display a new card's question and answer. The new question screen is accessed by the ‘+’ button and
returns to the main screen using either the ‘x’ button or the Save ‘arrow’ button, which will save the entered text to display as a new question. Cards are still not stored locally and new additions will overwrite the current question.

Further functionality is added. The can edit a card question and all answers. If any of these components are missing in an attempted save, a error message is shown. Lastly,
when a card is edited or created a message is also shown. This is because the Edit and Create functionalities share the same Activity. The colors for correct/wrong options are still not reset.
